# Submission Rules:
>
 ||
:-:|:-:
Try to explain the reasoning behind your view, not just what that view is (500+ *characters* required). [[More](http://goo.gl/vmihpz)] ▾| If your view is about someone having a "double standard", please see the [guidelines here](http://goo.gl/PTdqho).
You must personally hold the view and be open to it changing. ▾|A post cannot be neutral, on behalf of others, playing devil's advocate, or "soapboxing". Posts by throwaway accounts must be approved through [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fchangemyview). [[More](http://goo.gl/6NY08U)]
Submission titles must adequately sum up your view and include "CMV:" at the beginning. ▾|Posts with misleading/overly-simplistic titles may be removed. [[More](http://goo.gl/SROcfS)]
Meta posts are to be submitted to /r/ideasforcmv. ▾|Feasible suggestions that gain traction there may be implemented or posted to CMV for further discussion by the mods. [[More](http://goo.gl/yOwzLF)]
Only post if you are willing to have a conversation with those who reply to you, and are available to do so within 3 hours after posting. ▾|If you haven't replied during this time, your post will be removed. [[More](http://goo.gl/W4BqDk)]

# Comment Rules:
>
 ||
:-:|:-:
Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP’s stated view [(however minor)](http://goo.gl/eplcmY), unless they are asking a clarifying question. ▾|Arguments in favor of the view OP is willing to change must be restricted to replies to other comments. [[More](http://goo.gl/Uva9vF)]
Don't be rude or hostile to other users. ▾|Your comment will be removed even if the rest of it is solid. 'They started it' is not an excuse. You should report it, not respond to it. [[More](http://goo.gl/5oxw3f)]
Refrain from accusing OP or anyone else of being unwilling to change their view. ▾|If you are unsure whether someone is genuine, ask clarifying questions (see: [socratic method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)). If you think they are still exhibiting ill behaviour, please [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fchangemyview). [[More](http://goo.gl/NznLLm)]
If you have acknowledged/hinted that your view has changed in some way, please award a delta. ▾|You must also include an [explanation](http://goo.gl/Tu1543) of this change along with the delta. [[More](http://goo.gl/LzIwp1)]
No low effort comments. ▾|Comments that are *only* jokes or "written upvotes", for example. Humor and affirmations of agreement can be contained within more substantial comments. [[More](http://goo.gl/85EMhj)]

###### The delta (∆) system
**Has your V been C'd?**  
See [comment rule 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4).

**Awarding a delta**:  
Reply to the user(s) who changed your view with ∆ included in your comment, which can be copied above or created using one of the following:  
**&amp;#8710;** = ∆ ([unicode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode); works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and smartphones)  
**Option/Alt+J** = ∆ (Mac only)  
**Ctrl&Shift+u2206** = ∆ (Linux only)

/u/DeltaBot will deal with scores, wiki pages and leaderboards, more info on which can be found [here](http://goo.gl/ZlN6KW).

**Please message the mods if you suspect misuse/abuse of the delta.**
